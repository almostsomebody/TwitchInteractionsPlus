# TwitchInteractionsPlus
for streamers who want to award the most active chatters on their streams

# IMPORTANT!!! EDITING SETTINGS.JSON
This section is a must-read for ALL users who have just downloaded the app. For starters,
when first installing the app, it will set the chat to my stream, which is a template for
new streamers to add their own data. 

* Get Your Twitch OAuth Token (Put It In The IRC-TOKEN Value In Settings) here: https://twitchapps.com/tmi/

* IRC-NAME is the name of your twitch channel

* There are two modes, Light/Dark. THESE ARE CASE SENSITIVE!!! If you do not type exactly "Light", it will give you dark mode

* In order to remove background, begin window capture in streamlabs, go to chroma key, and select custom under the key colors section. Then press "screen color" and 
select the background element of the widget. It should be working now.
